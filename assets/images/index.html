            Music has always been a huge part of my life. I been playing guitar
            ever since Middle School and trying to keep at it when I have free
            time. Mostly play metal music in my younger days but lately been
            experimenting with more calmer melodies. Started to record for
            videos for YouTube to see what others think and so far, been a
            positive experience. Click

            I grew to enjoy watching videos on YouTube and in the back of my
            mind wondered if I could do something like that. I created a channel
            to focus on tabletop games and try my hand. Got to learn
            PowerDirector 365 then move to Premeire Pro. Click

            I was a gamer growing up and wanted to try to persue it as a career.
            I went to Community College for Game Development. I've enjoyed the
            coding part of it. Life happen and now picked up coding in Web
            Development. So far, been enjoying it. Click

            My wife loves to take pictures. We got a $200 camera and were taking
            pictures of use that turned out really well. Eventually, did
            photoshoots for family for their special occusions. Of course with the evolution of technology, most of our pictures are taken on our phones.
